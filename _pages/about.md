Hi! I'm Sasha Strong. I'm a psychotherapist in private practice at [Brilliancy Counseling](https://www.brilliancycounseling.com) in Portland, Oregon. I'm also a PhD candidate at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, where my dissertation research focuses on how people use Buddhist mindfulness practice to recover from bipolar disorder. I also offer trainings on transgender, non-binary and genderqueer cultural competency in healthcare.

My background 
======
I'm currently a PhD candidate in [East-West Psychology](https://www.ciis.edu/academics/graduate-programs/east-west-psychology/) at the California Institute of Integral Studies. I earned my MA in [Contemplative Psychotherapy](https://www.naropa.edu/academics/masters/clinical-mental-health-counseling/contemplative-psychotherapy-buddhist-psychology/index.php) at Naropa University in Boulder, CO, and my BA in French Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. I spent some time in Belgium after high school, and I speak fluent French.

My interests
======
My clinical and academic interests include psychotherapy, mindfulness, queer and trans issues, Buddhism, critical theory, and social justice. I have also studied and practiced Hakomi body-centered psychotherapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, humanistic and transpersonal psychology, and the therapeutic common factors.

Research
======
I'm currently focused on finishing my Ph.D. My three-article dissertation is mostly written, but completion depends on the timetables of academic publication. A few years ago, I also conducted a qualitative participatory action research pilot study on non-binary and genderqueer competency in counseling.

Teaching
======
I have taught as adjunct faculty at graduate and undergraduate levels, worked as a teaching assistant, given invited talks on psychotherapy and mindfulness, and offered gender competency trainings. These pages have more info on the [teaching](https://sashastrong.github.io/teaching/) and [talks](https://sashastrong.github.io/talks/) I've done.

Clinical work
======
In terms of my [psychotherapy practice](https://www.brilliancycounseling.com), I'm a Licensed Professional Counselor in Oregon, where I'm qualified to provide clinical supervision for LPC and LMFT interns. The main populations I serve are transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming individuals, for whom I offer individual therapy, support groups, and letters of support for gender affirmation procedures. I also enjoy working with counseling trainees, folks who want to integrate initial psychotic episodes or extraordinary experiences, and those seeking to recover from trauma using social, somatic, and transpersonal approaches.
