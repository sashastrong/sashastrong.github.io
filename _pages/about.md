Hi! I'm Sasha Strong. I'm a psychotherapist in private practice at [Brilliancy Counseling](https://www.brilliancycounseling.com) in Portland, Oregon. In my clinical work, I focus on helping transgender, non-binary, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming folks.
I'm also a PhD candidate at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco. My dissertation research focuses on how people use Buddhist mindfulness practice to recover from bipolar disorder.
I've also done some qualitative research on non-binary and genderqueer cultural competency in healthcare, and I offer trainings based on that work.

My background 
======
I'm currently a PhD candidate in [East-West Psychology](https://www.ciis.edu/academics/graduate-programs/east-west-psychology/) at the California Institute of Integral Studies. I earned my MA in [Contemplative Psychotherapy](https://www.naropa.edu/academics/masters/clinical-mental-health-counseling/contemplative-psychotherapy-buddhist-psychology/index.php) at Naropa University in Boulder, CO, and my BA in French Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. I spent some time in Belgium after high school, and I speak fluent French.

My interests
======
My clinical and academic interests include psychotherapy, mindfulness, queer and trans issues, Buddhism, critical theory, and social justice. I have also studied and practiced Hakomi body-centered psychotherapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, humanistic and transpersonal psychology, and the therapeutic common factors.

My research
======
I'm currently focused on finishing my Ph.D. My three-article dissertation is mostly written, but completion depends on the timetables of academic publication. A few years ago, I also conducted a qualitative participatory action research pilot study on non-binary and genderqueer competency in counseling.

My teaching
======
As for teaching, I've offered gender competency trainings, taught stress management at a community college, given invited talks on contemplative psychotherapy and gender therapy, developed video lectures and webinars, and worked as a teaching assistant.

My clinical work
======
In terms of my [psychotherapy practice](https://www.brilliancycounseling.com), I'm a Licensed Professional Counselor in Oregon, where I'm qualified to provide clinical supervision for LPC and LMFT interns. The main populations I serve are transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming individuals, for whom I offer individual therapy, support groups, and letters of support for gender affirmation procedures. I also enjoy working with counseling trainees, folks who want to integrate initial psychotic episodes or extraordinary experiences, and those seeking to recover from trauma using social, somatic, and transpersonal approaches.
