I conducted this qualitative study for my dissertation. Although the papers haven't been published yet, here are some resources related to that project.

## Study Findings
Here's a quick visual overview of the main findings. 


### Mindfulness Overview

Participants reported beneficial effects of mindfulness practice, using a variety of different mindfulness practices, and learning about mindfulness from several different Buddhist traditions.

### Mindfulness Effects

There were three categories of beneficial effects: building capacity for health, emotion regulation, and shift in experiential perspective. 

Participants also reported a few adverse effects, like hyperventilation and pain during meditation. These effects either subsided over time, or participants found ways to adapt meditation practice to reduce adverse effects, such as by switching to a different technique.
