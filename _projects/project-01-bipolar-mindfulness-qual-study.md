I conducted this qualitative study for my dissertation. Although the papers haven't been published yet, here are some resources related to that project.

## Design, Method, Recruitment

I interviewed 9 individuals who reported using Buddhist-informed mindfulness practice to recover from bipolar disorder. They had to have experienced recovery in at least one of 5 dimensions: symptom reduction, disease remission, improved quality of life, psychosocial rehabilitation, and social empowerment. Candidates contacted me using an online form and participated in a brief phone screen. After that, received study information and submitted an attestation from a psychiatrist that they were well enough to participate in the study and had previously met diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. Exclusion criteria included experiencing mania, major depression, or a psychotic episode in the six months leading up to the study.

The method was [thematic analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235356393_Using_thematic_analysis_in_psychology) using a pragmatic phenomenological frame. I transcribed the interviews and analyzed them using qualitative data analysis software [f4analyse](https://www.audiotranskription.de/english/f4-analyse). A screenshot from the f4analyse file:

I also used Scapple visual mindmapping software to sort codes into themes and overarching hierarchy. This image shows the subset of mindfulness themes:

The open-ended interview guide asked participants about their lived experience using Buddhist-informed mindfulness practice to recover from bipolar disorder, in order to gather information that could be helpful in crafting a novel approach to recovery.

In general, themes had convergence in at least 3 participant accounts, except as noted below. 

## Study Findings

More detailed results are forthcoming in published articles; this page gives an overview of study findings. This section is organized in terms of mindfunlness, other wellness practices, and other findings.


### Mindfulness Overview

Participants reported beneficial effects of mindfulness practice, using a variety of different mindfulness practices, and learning about mindfulness from several different Buddhist traditions.

### Mindfulness Effects

There were three categories of beneficial effects: building capacity for health, emotion regulation, and shift in experiential perspective.

#### Building capacity for health

Participants reported that mindfulness practice enhanced their capacity for health. This included themes of:
* building a foundation
* cultivating resilience
* ending bipolar patterns
* medical benefits
* positive life outcomes

#### Emotion regulation

Mindfulness practice seemed to have a large influence on participants' capacity for emotion regulation, which is clearly a core concern in bipolar disorder. Child themes included: 

* emotional self-awareness
* working with emotions directly
* emotional healing
* emotional resilience
* improved emotional relationship with self
* emotional freedom and reduced reactivity
* positive emotional changes

Enhanced emotional self-awareness seemed to be a key capacity that made the other emotion regulation strategies possible.

#### Shift in experiential perspective

Participants felt that mindfulness led to major changes in their experience, including:

* cognitive clarity
* shift in relationship to bipolar diagnosis
* accepting and transforming self and experience
* opening to vastness
* embodied presence
* integrating mindful awareness and experience
* unconditional confidence

#### Adverse effects

Participants also reported a few adverse effects, like hyperventilation and pain during meditation. These effects either subsided over time, or participants found ways to adapt meditation practice to reduce adverse effects, such as by switching to a different technique.

### Mindfulness Practices

Participants used sitting meditation and a variety of other mindfulness practices, which they integrated in an individualized approach to recovery.

#### Sitting meditation

This study did not prescribe a specific technique or treatment protocol, but defined sitting meditation loosely. However, sitting meditation was a basic recruitment criterion, and participants needed to have practiced at least 45 minutes a week during a 6 month period, sometime in the 2 years leading up to the study. Participants reported many different techniques and emphasess in their sitting meditation practices. These included:

* Techniques
  * shamatha-vipashyana
  * open awareness
  * metta towards mindstates
  * Goenka vipassana
  * investigating thoughts and emotions
  * basic meditation - 'BFM'

* Supports/objects
  * breath
  * body sensations, body awareness
  * sense perceptions
  * thoughts
  * emotions

* Guided meditation

Thus, even within the category of sitting meditation, there were a variety of different approaches, and participants deployed different techniques and instructions to work with different aspects of their experience as their meditation career and recovery from bipolar disorder evolved.


#### Other practices

Participants used many practices besides sitting meditation.

* Generative practices
  * Cultivating adaptive emotions
  * Devotional practices
  * Visualization practices

* Embodiment practices

* Investigative practices

* Informal practice in daily life

#### Adaptations and concerns
